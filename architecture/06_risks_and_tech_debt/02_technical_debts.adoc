= Technical Debt

////
[NOTE]
Known shortcuts or deficiencies that exist in the current implementation. These items are acknowledged trade-offs made to meet the 8-week MVP timeline.
////

The following technical debt items represent known deficiencies in the MVP implementation. They are acknowledged and planned for future resolution:

== MVP Technical Debt

[cols="1,1,4,4", id=technical-debt, options="header"]
|===
|ID |Severity |Description |Remediation Plan

|[[TD1]]TD1
|High
|Limited automated test coverage for AI safety filters due to time constraints
|Post-MVP sprint dedicated to increasing safety filter test coverage to 95%+

|[[TD2]]TD2
|High
|No persistent user preferences or personalization (kids platform)
|By design for COPPA compliance, but may add opt-in parent-controlled preferences in future

|[[TD3]]TD3
|Medium
|Single backend instance (no horizontal scaling configured)
|Implement Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling post-MVP

|[[TD4]]TD4
|Medium
|Voice AI only supports 3 languages (IT, FR, EN) at launch
|Add Japanese, German, Spanish in Phase 2 (per roadmap)

|[[TD5]]TD5
|Medium
|Basic parental activity reports (aggregate only)
|Enhanced reporting dashboard with more granular (but privacy-safe) insights

|[[TD6]]TD6
|Medium
|E-commerce limited to basic checkout flow
|Advanced features (subscriptions, gift cards, loyalty) deferred to post-MVP

|[[TD7]]TD7
|Low
|Minimal documentation for internal APIs
|Generate OpenAPI specs and documentation post-MVP

|[[TD8]]TD8
|Low
|Limited visual regression testing coverage
|Implement Percy/Chromatic for comprehensive visual testing

|[[TD9]]TD9
|Low
|Manual deployment for mobile app updates
|Implement CodePush for OTA updates (non-native changes)
|===

== Architecture Debt

[cols="1,1,4,4", id=architecture-debt, options="header"]
|===
|ID |Severity |Description |Remediation Plan

|[[AD1]]AD1
|Medium
|Monolithic NestJS backend (all modules in single deployment)
|Evaluate microservices split if scaling becomes an issue

|[[AD2]]AD2
|Medium
|No message queue for async operations
|Add RabbitMQ/Redis Streams for better decoupling and reliability

|[[AD3]]AD3
|Low
|CMS content not fully optimized for global CDN distribution
|Implement edge caching strategy with ISR optimization

|[[AD4]]AD4
|Low
|No feature flag system for gradual rollouts
|Implement LaunchDarkly or similar for controlled feature releases
|===

== Deferred Features (Not Technical Debt)

The following items are explicitly out of scope for MVP and not considered technical debt:

* Self-hosted AI models
* Advanced analytics dashboard
* Push notifications
* Additional languages beyond IT/FR/EN
* Persistent user profiles (kids)
* AI personalization based on history
* Offline mode improvements

== Debt Payment Schedule

[cols="1,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Priority |Items |Target Timeline |Effort Estimate

|P1 - Critical
|TD1 (Safety test coverage)
|MVP + 2 weeks
|1 sprint

|P2 - High
|TD3 (Scaling), AD1 (Microservices evaluation)
|MVP + 1 month
|2 sprints

|P3 - Medium
|TD4-TD6, AD2-AD3
|MVP + 2 months
|3 sprints

|P4 - Low
|TD7-TD9, AD4
|MVP + 3 months
|2 sprints

== Debt Tracking

* Technical debt items are tracked in the project backlog with `tech-debt` label
* Reviewed in bi-weekly architecture review meetings
* Prioritized against feature work based on impact and risk
* New debt must be documented before acceptance
