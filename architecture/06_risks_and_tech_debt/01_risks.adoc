The following risks represent potential future uncertainties that may impact the system if not addressed:

== Technical Risks

[cols="1,1,4,4", id=technical-risks, options="header"]
|===
|ID |Severity |Description |Mitigation

|[[R1]]R1
|Critical
|AI Safety Filter Bypass - LLM generates inappropriate content that passes through safety filters
|Multi-layer filtering (input + output), adversarial testing, continuous monitoring, human review of flagged content, immediate hotfix capability

|[[R2]]R2
|High
|LLM Provider Instability - Primary AI provider experiences outages or performance degradation
|Provider abstraction layer enabling hot-swap to backup provider (Together AI ↔ Claude), health monitoring, automatic failover

|[[R3]]R3
|High
|Voice AI Latency - End-to-end voice interactions exceed acceptable latency thresholds
|Streaming responses, text fallback option, performance optimization, edge processing investigation

|[[R4]]R4
|Medium
|Third-party API Changes - ElevenLabs, Whisper, or Shopify APIs change or deprecate features
|Adapter pattern for all integrations, version pinning, monitoring API changelogs, contingency providers identified

|[[R5]]R5
|Medium
|Mobile App Store Rejection - App rejected due to COPPA concerns or content policy violations
|Pre-submission legal review, Apple/Google guidelines compliance checklist, soft launch via TestFlight/Internal Testing

|[[R6]]R6
|Medium
|Performance Under Load - System degrades during peak usage (after-school hours)
|Load testing at 2x expected peak, auto-scaling configuration, CDN optimization, graceful degradation strategy
|===

== Business Risks

[cols="1,1,4,4", id=business-risks, options="header"]
|===
|ID |Severity |Description |Mitigation

|[[R7]]R7
|High
|Timeline Overrun - 8-week MVP timeline not achievable due to scope or technical challenges
|Strict MVP scope enforcement, daily standups, early risk identification, scope trade-off decisions, feature prioritization matrix

|[[R8]]R8
|High
|Design Dependencies - UX/UI designs not finalized before development begins
|Design-first sprint 0, designs must be locked before feature development, parallel design/dev where possible

|[[R9]]R9
|Medium
|Voice Training Quality - Custom character voices don't meet quality expectations
|Early voice training initiation, multiple sample recordings, iterative refinement, professional voice actors backup

|[[R10]]R10
|Medium
|Brand/IP Constraints - Calimero IP holder requires changes that impact architecture
|Early stakeholder alignment, regular brand review checkpoints, flexible content management
|===

== Compliance Risks

[cols="1,1,4,4", id=compliance-risks, options="header"]
|===
|ID |Severity |Description |Mitigation

|[[R11]]R11
|Critical
|COPPA Non-Compliance - Platform found to violate COPPA regulations post-launch
|Zero data collection architecture, legal review, COPPA audit before launch, ongoing compliance monitoring

|[[R12]]R12
|High
|Privacy Breach - AI conversation data inadvertently logged or exposed
|Ephemeral storage only, log audit (no PII), encryption, security testing, incident response plan

|[[R13]]R13
|Medium
|GDPR Compliance (Adult Site) - User data handling violates GDPR requirements
|Privacy by design, data processing agreements with vendors, user consent mechanisms, data export/deletion capabilities
|===

== Safety Risks

[cols="1,1,4,4", id=safety-risks, options="header"]
|===
|ID |Severity |Description |Mitigation

|[[R14]]R14
|Critical
|Child Safety Incident - Child is exposed to harmful content or interaction through the platform
|Multi-layer safety architecture, emergency detection, topic boundaries, continuous monitoring, incident response protocol, legal team on standby

|[[R15]]R15
|High
|Emergency Detection Failure - System fails to detect and respond appropriately to emergency situations
|Regular testing of detection patterns, conservative trigger thresholds, fallback to safe responses, human review process
|===

== Risk Monitoring

[cols="2,3,2", options="header"]
|===
|Risk Category |Monitoring Approach |Review Frequency

|Technical
|Performance dashboards, error tracking, provider status
|Daily

|Safety
|Safety filter metrics, incident reports
|Daily

|Compliance
|Audit checklist, legal review
|Weekly

|Business
