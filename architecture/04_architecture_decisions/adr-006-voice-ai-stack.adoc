= ADR 006: Voice AI Technology Stack Selection

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: December 2025

*Context*:
The mobile app requires voice AI interactions with character companions. The voice pipeline must:

* Convert child speech to text accurately (multiple languages)
* Generate character-specific voice responses
* Achieve <2 second total latency
* Support custom voice training for 5 characters
* Work reliably across varying audio quality

Options considered:

**Speech-to-Text (STT):**

1. OpenAI Whisper API - High accuracy, good multilingual
2. Google Cloud Speech-to-Text - Fast, good quality
3. AWS Transcribe - Integrated with AWS ecosystem
4. AssemblyAI - Good accuracy, streaming support

**Text-to-Speech (TTS):**

1. ElevenLabs - Best voice cloning, expressive
2. Google Cloud TTS - Good quality, many voices
3. Amazon Polly - Cost-effective, reliable
4. Azure Neural TTS - Good quality, multilingual

*Decision:*
We will use:

* **STT**: OpenAI Whisper API (with native device fallback)
* **TTS**: ElevenLabs with custom-trained voices per character

Voice characteristics for 5 characters:
|===
|Character |Voice Profile |Language Accent

|Calimero |Warm, empathetic, slight crack |Italian-influenced
|Priscilla |Soft, melodic, nurturing |Gentle, neutral
|Valeriano |Energetic, excited, adventurous |Bold, expressive
|Pierrot |Bouncy, playful, comedic |Light, fun
|Rosita |Clear, articulate, curious |Precise, educational
|===

*Consequences*:

*Positive:*

* Whisper's excellent multilingual support (IT, FR, EN)
* ElevenLabs produces natural, expressive voices
* Custom voice cloning creates unique character identities
* Both services have good latency characteristics
* Strong documentation and SDK support

*Negative:*

* ElevenLabs cost scales with usage
* Dependency on external services
* Voice training requires quality samples
* Latency varies by network conditions

*Mitigation:*

* Text fallback when voice fails
* Audio streaming (not waiting for complete audio)
* Pre-loaded voice models on ElevenLabs
* Cost monitoring and optimization
* Native device STT as fallback option
