= ADR 001: LLM Provider Selection for AI Companions

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: December 2025

*Context*:
The Calimero Platform requires an LLM (Large Language Model) provider to power AI companion conversations for children. The selection must consider:

* Child safety capabilities and content moderation
* Response quality and natural conversation flow
* Latency requirements (<1 second for text, <2 seconds for voice pipeline)
* Cost efficiency at scale (millions of monthly interactions)
* Provider reliability and uptime guarantees
* Data privacy and COPPA compliance
* Multi-language support (Italian, French, English)

Evaluated options:

1. **OpenAI GPT-4** - Industry leader, excellent quality, higher cost
2. **Anthropic Claude** - Strong safety focus, good quality, moderate cost
3. **Together AI** - Cost-effective, good quality, flexible deployment
4. **Self-hosted open-source** - Full control, high infrastructure cost

*Decision:*
We will use **Together AI** as the primary LLM provider with **Anthropic Claude** as the backup/failover provider.

*Rationale:*

* Together AI offers excellent cost-to-quality ratio for high-volume usage
* Together AI provides multiple model options for optimization
* Claude's Constitutional AI approach aligns with child safety requirements
* Both providers have strong data privacy commitments (no training on user data)
* Provider abstraction layer allows easy switching if needed

*Consequences*:

*Positive:*

* Cost-effective scaling for MVP and beyond
* Dual-provider strategy ensures high availability
* Both providers support required languages
* Strong safety capabilities from both providers

*Negative:*

* Need to maintain abstraction layer for provider switching
* Slightly different response characteristics between providers
* Additional complexity in failover logic

*Mitigation:*

* Implement robust LLM adapter with unified interface
* Tune prompts for consistency across providers
* Automated failover with health checks
