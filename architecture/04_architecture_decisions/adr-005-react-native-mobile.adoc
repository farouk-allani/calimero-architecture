= ADR 005: React Native for Mobile App Development

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: December 2025

*Context*:
The Calimero Kids Mobile App must be available on both iOS and Android with:

* Voice AI interactions with low latency
* Rive animations with lip-sync
* Offline capabilities
* Native performance feel
* Fast development within 8-week timeline

Options considered:

1. **Native development (Swift + Kotlin)** - Best performance, highest cost
2. **React Native** - Cross-platform, JavaScript/TypeScript
3. **Flutter** - Cross-platform, Dart language
4. **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - Web-based, limited native features

*Decision:*
We will use **React Native** with TypeScript for the mobile app development.

*Rationale:*

* Single codebase for iOS and Android
* Team expertise in TypeScript (shared with web)
* Excellent Rive animation support
* Strong audio APIs for voice features
* Large ecosystem and community
* Code sharing potential with web apps
* Faster development than native

*Consequences*:

*Positive:*

* Single codebase reduces development time by ~40%
* TypeScript consistency across all platforms
* Hot reloading speeds development
* Large community and library ecosystem
* Rive integration well-supported
* Native modules available for audio/voice

*Negative:*

* Slightly lower performance than pure native
* Some platform-specific code still needed
* Dependency on React Native release cycle
* Bundle size larger than native

*Mitigation:*

* Use Hermes engine for better performance
* Native modules for performance-critical features
* Thorough testing on both platforms
* Performance profiling and optimization
